WEB SERVICE
    
    - Software system designed to support interoperable (not platform dependend)
      machine-to-machine interaction
      over a network.

    - To make the requesr platform independent, we need to make
      the request and response platform independent.

    - Every web service offers Service Definition, thar specifies:
            - request and response format;


KEY TERMINOLIGY:

    - Request is the inout of our service;

    - Response is teh ouptup from a web-service;

    - Message Exchange format - is a format of the request and the response (XML, JSON);

    - Service Provider - the one, which hosts the web-service;

    - Sevice Consumer - the one, who uses the service;

    - Service Definition - is a contract between the service provider and service consumers;

    - Endpoint definew what URL is the service is exposed at.
        - How can these service counsumer call this service which is 
          exposed by the service provider.

    - Transport - defines how a service is called: Internet (HTTP) or MQ

    - MQ - the service requester would place a message in the queue;
         - the service provider would be listening on the queue;
         - And as soon as there is a requset on the queue, it would take the request,
           do the processing of it, create the response and put it back in the queue and 
           the service requseter would get the response from the queue.


SOAP WEB SERVICES:

       -  REST defines an architectual approach;
       -  SOAP exposes restrictions on the format of XML, whih is exchanged between your service provider
          and the service consumer;

       - SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol, defines a specific way of building web services.

       - SOAP defines a specific XML request and response structure:

                SOAP-ENV: Envelope, contains:

                SOAP-ENV: Header (optional)
                SOAP-ENV: Body

        The header contains meta information like 
        - authentication,
        - authorization,
        - signatures

        The body contains the real content or the request or response.


        - In SOAP service definition is typically done using something called
          Web Service Definition Language (WSDL)

        - WSDL defines the Endpoint, it defines all the operations that are exposed.
        
        - And also it specifies teh request and response structure;
